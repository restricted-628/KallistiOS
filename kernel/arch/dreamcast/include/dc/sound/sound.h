    \brief   Low-level sound support and memory management.
    \ingroup audio_driver

    This file contains declarations for low-level sound operations and for SPU
    RAM pool memory management. Most of the time you'll be better off using the
    higher-level functionality in the sound effect support or streaming support,
    but this stuff can be very useful for some things.

    This function acts as the memory allocator for the SPU RAM pool. It acts
    much like one would expect a malloc() function to act, although it does not
    return a pointer directly, but rather an offset in SPU RAM.

    \param  size            The amount of memory to allocate, in bytes.

    \return                 The location of the start of the block on success,

    Source data and both destinations must be 32-byte aligned. size is the
    interleaved byte count and must be divisible by 32; each destination needs
    size / 2 bytes. Destinations may be sound-RAM offsets or direct physical,
    P1, or P2 sound-RAM addresses, and must not overlap.

    This function acquires its own store queues and handles either MMU state.
    It does not resolve translated application destination pointers. Uploads
    use bounded, separately mapped channel batches with no heap allocation.
    The final 16 bytes per channel, when present, are written with PIO.

    The caller owns both destination ranges and must coordinate playback or
    other writers. Completion is synchronous, but the two channel updates are
    not atomic. This function may block and must not run in interrupt context.

    \param data   Source buffer of interleaved little-endian L/R PCM16 frames
    \param left   Left channel sound-RAM offset or direct address
    \param right  Right channel sound-RAM offset or direct address
    \param size   Source bytes (multiple of 32); zero is a no-op

    \note This legacy void API records errors in errno: EINVAL for invalid
    arguments/ranges, EPERM in interrupt context, or the sq_lock() error.
    Argument errors occur before any writes. An acquisition failure in a
    later batch can leave a completed prefix or one channel updated.
