    This module encapsulates all the system calls available in the Dreamcast
    BIOS, allowing direct interaction with system hardware
    components such as the GDROM drive, flash ROM, and bios fonts. These
    functions are essential for performing low-level operations that are not
    handled by standard user-space APIs.
