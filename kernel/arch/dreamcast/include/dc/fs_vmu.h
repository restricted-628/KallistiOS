    \brief   VMU filesystem driver.
    \ingroup vfs_vmu

    The VMU filesystem driver mounts itself on /vmu of the VFS. Each memory card
    has its own subdirectory off of that directory (i.e, /vmu/a1 for slot 1 of
    the first controller). VMUs themselves have no subdirectories, so the driver
    itself is fairly simple.

    VMU storage allocates whole 512-byte blocks. For valid package files, normal
    VFS access reports and operates on the exact logical payload length rather
    than the package header or final block padding. Opening with O_META exposes
    the complete block-rounded on-card image instead.

    This layer is built off of the vmufs layer, which does all the low-level
    operations. It is generally easier to work with things at this level though,
    so that you can use the normal libc file access functions.

    Each open file is cached independently. Applications must serialize
    writers to the same file and must not modify it concurrently through direct
    block access or the lower-level vmufs interface.
