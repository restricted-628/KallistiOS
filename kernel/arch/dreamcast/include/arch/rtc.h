    \brief   Low-level real-time clock functionality.
    \ingroup rtc

    This file contains functions for interacting with the real-time clock in the
    Dreamcast. Generally, you should prefer interacting with the higher level
    standard C functions, like time(), rather than these when simply needing
    to fetch the current system time.

/* Notes:
    The RTC that is used by the DC is located on the AICA rather than SH4,
    presumably for power-efficiency reasons. Because of this, accessing
    it requires a trip over the G2 BUS, which is notoriously slow.

    Internally, the RTC's date/time is maintained using a 32-bit counter
    with an epoch of January 1, 1950 00:00. Because of this, the Dreamcast's
    Y2K and the last timestamp it can represent before rolling over is
    February 06 2086 06:28:15.
