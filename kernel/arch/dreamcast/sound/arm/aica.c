   ch is the channel to play on (0 - 63)
   smpptr is the pointer to the sound data; if you're running off the
     SH4, then this ought to be (ptr - 0xa0800000); otherwise it's just
     ptr. Basically, it's an offset into sound ram.
   mode is one of the mode constants (16 bit, 8 bit, ADPCM)
   nsamp is the number of samples to play (not number of bytes!)
   freq is the sampling rate of the sound
   vol is the volume, 0 to 0xff (0xff is louder)
   pan is a panning constant -- 0 is left, 128 is center, 255 is right.

   This routine (and the similar ones) owe a lot to Marcus' sound example --
