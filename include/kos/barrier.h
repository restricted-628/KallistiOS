    \brief      Thread barriers.
    \ingroup    barriers

    Thread barriers are used to synchronize the progress of multiple threads. A
    barrier causes threads to wait until a specified number of threads have
    reached a certain execution point, ensuring a consistent state across
    different execution paths.

    This synchronization primitive is essential for scenarios in parallel
    programming where tasks executed by multiple threads must reach a certain
    point before any can proceed, ensuring data consistency and coordination
    among threads.
