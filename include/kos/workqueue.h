    \brief   Threaded work queue support.
    \ingroup kthreads

    This file contains the API to create and manage work queues.

    A work queue is a thread that will execute tasks (aka. jobs) that are
    enqueued by client code, at a predeterminated moment in time. Multiple
    jobs can be enqueued. Once a job is executed, it is removed from the
    execution queue.
