    \brief  Mutual exclusion locks.
    \ingroup kthreads

    This file defines mutual exclusion locks (or mutexes for short). The concept
    of a mutex is one of the most common types of locks in a multi-threaded
    environment. Mutexes do exactly what they sound like, they keep two (or
    more) threads mutually exclusive from one another. A mutex is used around
    a block of code to prevent two threads from interfering with one another
    when only one would be appropriate to be in the block at a time.

    KallistiOS implements 2 types of mutexes, normal mutexes and recursive
    mutexes. Internally the implementation is the same, the only difference lies
    in error-checking. When assert() calls are disabled (by setting the NDEBUG
    macro), they should have the exact same behaviour.

    A normal mutex (MUTEX_TYPE_NORMAL) is roughly equivalent to a semaphore that
    has been initialized with a count of 1. If assert() is disabled, there is no
    protection against threads unlocking normal mutexes they didn't lock, nor is
    there any protection against a thread locking the same mutex twice.

    A recursive mutex (MUTEX_TYPE_RECURSIVE) allows you to lock the mutex
    N times in the same thread; in which case, the mutex has to be unlocked N
    times for the mutex to be effectively released. Still only one thread can
    hold the lock, but it may hold it as many times as it needs to.
