    \brief   Semaphores.
    \ingroup kthreads

    This file defines semaphores. A semaphore is a synchronization primitive
    that allows a specified number of threads to be in its critical section at a
    single point of time. Another way to think of it is that you have a
    predetermined number of resources available, and the semaphore maintains the
    resources.
