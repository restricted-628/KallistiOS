   gprof.c
   Copyright (C) 2025 Andy Barajas

   Exercises the libgprof runtime end to end: histogram time sampling and the
   call-graph recorder, producing a standard gmon.out for host-side gprof.

   The workload is built from a few out-of-line functions with a clear call
   hierarchy, so both halves of the profile are interesting:

     - the flat profile (where time is spent) is dominated by spin(), reached
       far more often through hot_path() than warm_path();
     - the call graph shows main -> workload -> {hot_path, warm_path, fibonacci}
       -> spin(), with spin()'s time split across its two callers, plus
       fibonacci()'s recursive self-edge.

   Nothing here calls into the runtime directly: linking with -pg auto-starts
   profiling before main() (via the weak gprof_init() hook) and flushes gmon.out
   on exit. Build/run/report steps are in README.md.

   A couple of details keep the optimizer from spoiling the demo:

     - the helpers are __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) so each stays a distinct
       symbol in the report; hot_path()/warm_path() additionally carry no_icf so
       GCC's identical-code folding doesn't merge their identical bodies into one
       symbol. Otherwise the call graph would show only one caller of spin()
       instead of the intended two.
     - spin() takes its iteration count from a volatile, so -O2 cannot prove the
       call is loop-invariant and hoist it out of the loop -- otherwise spin()
       would run once per caller instead of hundreds of times.

   Results feed a volatile sink so nothing is dead-code eliminated.
